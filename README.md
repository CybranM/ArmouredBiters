# ArmouredBiters
https://mods.factorio.com/mod/ArmouredBiters

This mod adds a new type of enemy to the game called Snappers (which don't replace regular biters), they're a bit slower but have more health and resistance than regular biters. Unlike regular biters, snappers have laser resistance to make building late game defences a bit more interesting.
They spawn at the same pollution levels as regular biters at regular biter nests, for example if the biter nest can spawn a medium biter it can also spawn a medium snapper.

Note that the option to enable armoured biter nest works best when creating a new world as they wont spawn in regular biter nests with the option enabled.
